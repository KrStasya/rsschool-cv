## About me:


Hello there. I like programming, but at the moment there is no commercial experience, everyone needs serers at the price of interns. Therefore, to improve my level, I constantly self-study and the prefix free courses from RSS just captured me. Thank you for such a great opportunity. I'll be sure to give it a go once I get my dream job.

_P.s. I need to rewrite later why I'm cool and everyone needs me_
